# Welcome

**unfsckthe.eu** is a collaborative knowledge base dedicated to helping Citizens lobby the European Union more effectively. It is currently under development so expect lots of blank pages for now.

Do you have experience in the Eurobubble? Would you like to contribute to the project? [Reach out to us](/pages/contact), or contribute directly via [github](https://github.com/jmaris/unfsckthe.eu)!

# Getting Started

The EU is making more and more laws that affect our lives, and while many of them are positive, they don't always get it right. Luckily, we can help change that: because **when citizens speak up, the EU does listen**.

The problem is that we are outgunned: European businesses spend billions every year, hiring well-connected lobbyists who understand the inner workings of the EU. This website is about levelling the playing field, giving citizens the knowledge and tools they need to get their voices heard!

If you are new to lobbying the EU, we recommend reading our Getting Started Guide to get a grasp of the basics, before moving on to learning about how to lobby the EU.
