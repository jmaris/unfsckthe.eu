# Ordinary Legislative Procedure
_Ordinary Legislative Procedure_ is the main way the EU makes laws. In this system:
1. the European Commission prepares a proposal, and sends it to the European Parliament and the Council.
2. Inside the Parliament, MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) debate and negotiate to agree on a list of changes to the law (amendments) that they want to make. Once they are done, Parliament votes on a "Report": a document containing all the changes that Parliament wants to make.
3. Inside the council, a similar process takes place simultaneously.
4. Once both the Parliament and council have a position, they negotiate with each other in _Trilogues_ to find a compromise. If they can agree, then the proposal becomes law.

Below you will find a flowchart illustrating the process, followed by explanations about each stage, and links to pages where you can find tips about how you can influence each stage.

## Agenda Forming
The first step in the process is for the [European Commission](https://unfsckthe.eu/pages/getting_started/institutions.html#the-european-commission) to decide to make a law about something.

The Commission can decide to make a law at its own initiative or for one or more of three reasons:

**Parliament asked them to**

While the European Parliament cannot propose laws itself, it can ask the Commission to propose a law to address an issue. The Commission must respond, either with a proposal for a law or an explanation of why they do not want to take action.

**Citizens asked them to**

Citizens can directly make a call for action using the [European Citizens Initiative](https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/_en). To do so, they must collect 1 million signatures of EU citizens. The Commission must respond, either with a proposal for a law or an explanation of why they do not want to take action.

**EU Member States ask them to**

The [Council of the European Union](https://unfsckthe.eu/pages/getting_started/institutions.html#the-council-of-the-european-union) (Representatives from EU countries' governments), can ask the Commission to act through _Council Resolutions_. Exceptionally, the European Council (a meeting of the leaders of each EU country) can ask the Commission to take action. The Commission must respond, either with a proposal for a law or an explanation of why they do not want to take action.
