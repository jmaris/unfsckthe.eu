# unfsckthe.eu

unfsckthe.eu is a collaborative knowledge base dedicated to helping Citizens lobby the European Union more effectively. It is currently under development so expect lots of blank pages for now.

Do you have experience in the Eurobubble? Would you like to contribute to the project? Reach out to us, or contribute directly via [github](https://github.com/jmaris/unfsckthe.eu)!
